# Project-5-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
The fifth project of the coding bootcamp is on the topic of supervised Machine Learning. In my case I elected to look at, and model, exo-planets.

An exo-planet is basically a planet that isn't in orbit around our star, the sun. The data on these planets were originally provided by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (http://phl.upr.edu/). The goal for my ML model was to predict if an exo-planet would be habitable based on the criterions for habitability used by PHL.

In the end I created two models with the second model only using data from the star that the exoplanet orbits. In short, the first model performed very well (nearly 100 % accuracy on test data) while the second model performed poorly (only 33 % precision).
